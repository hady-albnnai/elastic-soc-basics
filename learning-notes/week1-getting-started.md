# Foundation Phase: Mastering Elastic Stack Interface

Learning Period: January 2026 (2-3 weeks)  
Total Time Invested: 25+ hours of hands-on practice  
Current Status: ✅ Foundation Complete

## 📊 What I Mastered in This Phase

### 1. Complete System Navigation
- Kibana Core Modules:
  - Discover: Real-time log search and filtering
  - Visualize: Creating charts, graphs, and metrics
  - Dashboard: Building comprehensive monitoring views
  - Dev Tools: Direct Elasticsearch query interface
  - Stack Management: System configuration and monitoring

- Elasticsearch Fundamentals:
  - Index structure and management
  - Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Query DSL syntax and patterns

### 2. Data Management Skills
- Multiple Ingestion Methods:
  - Built-in sample datasets (eCommerce, web logs, flight data)
  - Manual CSV/JSON file uploads via UI
  - Programmatic ingestion using Dev Tools console
  - Understanding of Logstash pipelines (conceptual)

- Data Organization:
  - Creating and managing indices
  - Field mapping and data types (keyword vs text)
  - Index patterns for efficient searching

### 3. Initial Security Analysis Practice
- Brute Force Attack Simulation:
  - Analyzing failed authentication patterns
  - Identifying attack sources and timelines
  - Distinguishing between attacks and legitimate failures

- DDoS Pattern Recognition:
  - Detecting abnormal request volumes
  - Geographic source analysis
  - Time-series attack visualization

### 4. Visualization & Reporting
- Chart Creation:
  - Line charts for temporal analysis
  - Pie charts for distribution views
  - Data tables for detailed listings
  - Metric displays for key indicators

- Dashboard Development:
  - Combining multiple visualizations
  - Configuring time-based filters
  - Creating real-time monitoring views
  - Dashboard sharing and collaboration

## 🎯 Key Competencies Developed

| Data Ingestion | Intermediate | Multiple methods for different scenarios |
| Basic Querying | Intermediate | Can write and troubleshoot Elasticsearch queries |
| Visualization | Intermediate | Create meaningful charts and dashboards |
| Security Context | Beginner-Intermediate | Understands SOC use cases for Elastic |

## ⏱️ Time Investment Breakdown
- Week 1: 12 hours - System exploration and basic navigation
- Week 2: 8 hours - Data ingestion methods and management  
- Week 3: 8+ hours - Attack analysis and visualization practice
- Additional: 5+ hours - Documentation and experimentation

## 🔄 Transition to Next Phase
With these foundations solidly established, I'm now ready to:
1. Apply skills to realistic SOC scenarios
2. Focus on specific attack detection workflows
3. Develop operational dashboards for security monitoring
4. Document complete investigation processes
