# Elastic Stack Learning Journey for SOC Aspirants

Current Status: Learning & Building
My Level: SOC Aspirant / Beginner in Elastic Stack
Objective: Build practical understanding of ELK for security monitoring

## About This Repository
This is my personal learning project where I document my hands-on experience with Elastic Stack in the context of Security Operations. I'm building this from the ground up as I learn, focusing on practical skills needed for entry-level SOC roles.

## What I'm Currently Working On
1. Basic Setup: Learning to deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker
2. Log Fundamentals: Understanding how to ingest and parse basic security logs
3. First Queries: Writing simple Elasticsearch queries for common security events
4. Documentation: Recording my learning process and challenges

## Current Progress Summary
| Area | Status | My Current Skill Level |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| ELK Deployment | Basic setup complete | Beginner |
| Log Analysis | Learning fundamentals | Beginner |
| Query Writing | Starting with basic syntax | Beginner |
| SOC Context | Studying how ELK fits in SOC | Learning |

## For Other Beginners
If you're also starting with Elastic Stack for SOC work, you can:
1. Use the Docker setup here to start your own lab
2. Follow along as I document what I learn
3. See practical examples at a true beginner level

## For Experienced Analysts
If you have experience with Elastic in SOC environments:
- I welcome constructive feedback on my approach
- Suggestions for practical next steps are appreciated
- Corrections to misunderstandings are valuable

## My Background
- Current Focus: Building SOC fundamentals through TryHackMe
- Learning Path: SOC Level 1 → Log Analysis → Elastic Stack
- Approach: Hands-on practice with public documentation
